    summary: |
      I am an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano and I have worked
      in processor architecture research and development for one of the top
      semiconductor companies in the world. My background is rooted in modeling
      and simulation of digital systems although I have expanded my interests
      to functional programming and domain specific languages.
      Recently (2016) I've helped introduce some novel theoretical results
      in the field of cryptography and (in 2015 and 2017) I've been awarded
      with several grants from industrial partners for devising a reliable
      design methodology for cryptographic circuits.


    websiteSummary: |
      I am an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano and I have worked
      in processor architecture research and development for one of the top
      semiconductor companies in the world.

      Although my background is rooted in modeling and simulation of digital
      systems, I have expanded my interests to **parallel** and **asynchronous
      programming**, **domain specific languages** and automatic tools for the
      web. I also have a thing for **data visualization**, **infographics**
      and **javascript**. If you are inclined to work on these topics feel
      free to get in touch for a possible collaboration or a thesis.

      Troughout the years, I discovered that I love teaching by making
      students passionate about computer engineering. I like matching
      conventional methods for teaching with novel technology such as
      live-coding and program simulation. Besides, I
      am running a teaching experiment, called [Polimi at
      Home](http://www.pah.polimi.it), where my students can follow on-line
      tutorials (based on EDX technology) and be automatically graded.

    currentGoals:
      short: |
        I love studying and innovating all aspects of software and hardware
        development. Recently (2015) I have started working with
        STMicroelectronics on using functional programming languages for
        hardware design. In particular, I am investigating how deeply embedded
        DSLs can be used to produce a diverse set of artifacts (actual hardware
        specification, high-level simulators, functional and non-functional
        property proving).

        I am also interested into applying functional programming and category
        theory into the general context of asynchronous systems with a specific
        emphasis on web technologies.

    history:

      - from: 2015
        title: Countermeasures against side-channel attacks
        description: |
          This project started from an actual industrial need, i.e., providing
          the designer of cryptographic algorithms with guidelines and tools
          that make it possible to implement and validate the primitive while
          assessing the desired level of protection.

          The problems with existing methods and tools that brought us to seek
          new approaches are just a few; first, high level
          specification/prototyping of the algorithm is decoupled from low level
          implementation. This brings a host of issues, among which the fact
          that manual translation can introduce subtle bugs and unanticipated
          behavior. Besides this, the specification is usually done in weakly
          typed languages, bringing additional source of unexpected behavior,
          test and refactoring complexity.

          My main goal is to investigate how a strongly typed functional
          programming language could be used to build a DSLs to synthesize these
          kind of algorithms in hardware, by bridging the gap between spec and
          implementation with automatic tools.

        title: Techniques to support teaching to a massive amount of students
        description: |
          In 2014 I realized that my computer science class was undergoing a
          major challenge. The number of students was becoming huge and resource
          assignment from my university (in terms of teaching assistants funded
          by the university) was on a decreasing trend. In fact, the ratio
          between qualified teaching assistants (those who have a degree in
          computer engineering) and students had fallen below 1/100, making it
          hard to bring students to complete even the simplest hands-on lab. I
          always had the ambition to not leave anyone behind so I gradually
          started to study the current MOOC technologies to see whether they
          could be used to keep the students on track.

          Currently, I am creating the first online course that is meant to
          complement the face to face lectures that I give. The course can be
          edited collaboratively by teachers (on Github) through a YAML based
          format that I designed; it can then be imported into an EDX server to
          be used by the students who can submit their homework to an automatic
          grader that I wrote using containerization technology.

        achievements:
          - Developed a YAML-based format to author course contents.
          - Used containerization technology to build an automatic graders.

        title: Front-end development and mobile apps
        description: |
          I have been always interested in ways to model complex program behavior such
          as parallel and asynchronous programming. It turns out that web and mobile
          application present a lot of challenges from this point of view being
          inherently asynchronous.

          In this area I have collaborated with some researchers on the
          implementation of context-based applications for the customization of the
          user experience on mobile devices. This kind of application is characterized
          a query engine that fetches and mashes up data from different kind of
          services into a unified view on a native application. We decided to simplify
          the construction of the mobile application by shifting all the burden of
          service querying into the server. The mobile app uses then a flexible
          querying interface towards the server that minimizes data transfered across
          the network.

        title: Power estimation and optimization of processor-based systems
        description: |
          Since 1999, I have been interested into estimating and optimizing
          the power consumption of microprocessors and microprocessor-based
          systems.

        achievements:

          -   Developed an analytical model that takes into account
              software-level parameters (instruction ordering, pipeline stall
              probability and instruction cache miss probability) and
              micro-architectural-level ones (pipeline stage power per
              instruction).

          -   Validated the model on an industrial VLIW processor jointly
              designed by HPLabs and STMicroelectronics.

          -   Defined a register file write inhibition scheme that exploits
              the forwarding paths in VLIW processors.

          -   Designed a dynamic power management policy for general purpose operating systems.

          -   Designed a method for the exploration of the architectural
              parameters of the memory sub-systems, from the energy-delay joint perspective.

          -   Developed Multicube Explorer, a tool for experimenting with
              multi-objective exploration.

          -   Developed accurate performance and power modeling characterization of
              applications with emphasis on parallel processors architectures and
              network-on-chips.

          -   Developed optimal tuning of the memory hierarchy, processor parallelism (intra
              and inter-task) and processor interconnection network.

          -   Developed optimal software task mapping and scheduling onto the target
              processor units and optimal communication scheduling.

          -   Designed run-time design space exploration for trading-off quality-of-service
              with actual power constraints.

          -   Robust optimization with respect to several levels of uncertainties
              such as workload variability, model estimation accuracy and
              manufacturing process variability.

          -   Specified and implemented power characterization and
              high-level power estimation  work-flows for the STBus Network
              on Chip.  The STBus is a high-performance, low-latency on chip
              parameterizable network supported by production grade
              specification and synthesis tools.

          on the entire stack of hardware and software design tools for
          an embedded processor.


        achievements:

        -   Specified and validated embedded shared-memory multi-processor
            systems.

        -   Designed run-time and operating system components including
            embedded co-hosting technology for the ST230 microprocessor.

        -   Studied and created a parallel programming framework for
            industrial multi-processor architectures.

        -   Specified secure storage extensions for embedded processors.

        -   Developed secure co-hosting solutions for industrial applications.

        -   Involved in the study and implementation of novel cryptographic
            power attack techniques based on cache-miss induction.

    currentGoals: |
      Troughout the years, I discovered that I love teaching by making students
      passionate about computer engineering. I like matching conventional
      methods for teaching with novel technology such as MOOcs. In particular, I
      am running a teaching experiment, called [Polimi at
      Home](http://www.pah.polimi.it), where regular students can follow on-line
      tutorials (based on EDX technology) and be automatically graded.
