  These are some of the thesis projects that I am available to supervise. Some of them are pure 
  academic research while others are industry sponsored projects that include a stage.

      This thesis will be done in collaboration with Security Pattern.

      IoT is increasingly implemented using devices that might store sensitive
      information but otherwise work in an hostile environment. One of the most
      effective class of attacks that can be used to steal such sensitive
      information is implemented through a side-channel. A side-channel attack
      exploits a physical, measurable property of an otherwise secure
      implementation to exfiltrate sensitive data. Main examples are timing
      attacks, power analysis, electromagnetic analysis and fault injection.

      This thesis proposal aims at improving and extending the current
      hardware/software tools to implement an attack. The goal is to provide IoT
      designers with a easy to use device and software to find any vulnerability
      of the system under design. The candidate will work with and extend a
      ChipWhisperer board and its software.

      Expected outcomes:

      - Implement a hw/sw wrapper such that the board and its software could be
        used to attack a generic device (e.g., an ARM device, or an hardware
        implementation of AES)

      - Implement a hw/sw wrapper such that the board and its software could be
        attached to an arbitrary/more capable measurement device.
