  - name: RISCV open source microprocessor enhancement
    description: |
      This research project is configured with the following design activities

      - Evaluation of the RISCV microprocessor designed in the University of
        Berkeley, nowadays considered one of the most promising open source
        microprocessor.

      - Extension of its basic instruction set (ISA) with a new group of digital
        signal processing and computer vision instructions to address new emerging
        IOT radios and deep learning applications.

      The analysis of the new RISCV ISA will be performed at instruction
      abstraction level, the Chisel language could be one of the adopted solutions.
      The project can then be carried on in the hardware design phase if the
      candidate owns adequate skills and motivations.

  - name: Design of the next generation of STRED6 microprocessor-DSP 
    description: |
      The consolidated trend in the digital design is described by the use of
      high performance and energy efficient microprocessors, used in single or
      multiple configurations, where the associated firmware defines the target
      system-on-chip functionality.

      The STRED processor family is one of the key STMicroelectronics IP used in
      this set of advanced products. The new emerging applications require big
      changes in terms of performance in order to support advanced software
      defined radios and deep learning algorithms for computer vision.

      The activity will be concentrated in the instruction set (ISA) upgrades
      and micro-architecture adjustment (pipeline).

      The analysis of the new STRED6 ISA will be performed at instruction
      abstraction level. The project can then be completed with the hardware
      design.

  - name: Definition of the next STREDL microprocessor for sensor processing
    description: |
      Every sensor is more and more associated to a close elaboration unit with
      the task to filter the data before the transmission to the next collection
      unit or the Cloud.

      The next frontier is the adoption of neural network architectures, tightly
      coupled with the sensor, able to perform a first detection level of the
      retrieved information.

      The STREDL microprocessor is one of the key STMicroelectronics IP planned
      to be used in the sensor domain.

      Interacting with ST Deep Neural Network group the candidate should study
      and isolate the most promising net architectures for low power
      applications, suggest instruction set upgrades and micro-architecture
      adjustment.

      The analysis of the new STREDL ISA will be performed at instruction
      abstraction level. The project can then be completed with the hardware design.
