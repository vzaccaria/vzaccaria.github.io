  title: Countermeasures against side-channel attacks
  description: |
    This project started from an actual industrial need, i.e., providing the
    designer of cryptographic algorithms with guidelines and tools that make it
    possible to implement and validate the primitive while assessing the desired
    level of protection.

    The problems with existing methods and tools that brought us to seek new
    approaches are just a few; first, high level specification/prototyping of
    the algorithm is decoupled from low level implementation. This brings a host
    of issues, among which the fact that manual translation can introduce subtle
    bugs and unanticipated behavior. Besides this, the specification is usually
    done in weakly typed languages, bringing additional source of unexpected
    behavior, test and refactoring complexity.
    
    My main goal is to investigate how a strongly typed functional programming
    language could be used to build a DSLs to synthesize these kind of
    algorithms in hardware, by bridging the gap between spec and implementation
    with automatic tools.

  title: Techniques to support teaching to a massive amount of students
  description: |
    In 2014 I realized that my computer science class was undergoing a major
    challenge. The number of students was becoming huge and resource assignment
    from my university (in terms of teaching assistants funded by the
    university) was on a decreasing trend. In fact, the ratio between qualified
    teaching assistants (those who have a degree in computer engineering) and
    students had fallen below 1/100, making it hard to bring students to
    complete even the simplest hands-on lab.

    I always had the ambition to not leave anyone behind so I gradually started
    to study the current MOOC technologies to see whether they could be used to
    keep the students on track.

    I am currently creating the first online course that is meant to complement
    the face to face lectures that I give. The course can be edited
    collaboratively by teachers (on Github) through a YAML based format that I
    designed; it can then be imported into an EDX server to be used by the
    students who can submit their homework to an automatic grader that I wrote
    using containerization technology.

  achievements:
    - developed a YAML-based format to author course contents
    - used containerization technology to build an automatic graders

  title: Front-end development and mobile apps
  description: |
    I have been always interested in ways to model complex program behavior such
    as parallel and asynchronous programming. It turns out that web and mobile
    application present a lot of challenges from this point of view being
    inherently asynchronous.

    In this area I have collaborated with some researchers on the
    implementation of context-based applications for the customization of the
    user experience on mobile devices. This kind of application is characterized
    a query engine that fetches and mashes up data from different kind of
    services into a unified view on a native application. We decided to simplify
    the construction of the mobile application by shifting all the burden of
    service querying into the server. The mobile app uses then a flexible
    querying interface towards the server that minimizes data transfered across
    the network.

  title: Power estimation and optimization of processor-based systems
  description: |
    Since 1999, I have been interested into estimating and optimizing
    the power consumption of microprocessors and microprocessor-based
    systems. 

  achievements:

    -   developed an analytical model that takes into account
        software-level parameters (instruction ordering, pipeline stall
        probability and instruction cache miss probability) and
        micro-architectural-level ones (pipeline stage power per
        instruction)

    -   validated the model on an industrial VLIW processor jointly
        designed by HPLabs and STMicroelectronics

    -   defined a register file write inhibition scheme that exploits
        the forwarding paths in VLIW processors

    -   designed a dynamic power management policy for general purpose operating systems

    -   designed a method for the exploration of the architectural
        parameters of the memory sub-systems, from the energy-delay joint perspective

    -   developed Multicube Explorer, a tool for experimenting with
        multi-objective exploration

    -   developed accurate performance and power modeling characterization of
        applications with emphasis on parallel processors architectures and
        network-on-chips.

    -   developed optimal tuning of the memory hierarchy, processor parallelism (intra
        and inter-task) and processor interconnection network

    -   developed optimal software task mapping and scheduling onto the target
        processor units and optimal communication scheduling

    -   designed run-time design space exploration for trading-off quality-of-service
        with actual power constraints

    -   robust optimization with respect to several levels of uncertainties
        such as workload variability, model estimation accuracy and
        manufacturing process variability

    -   specified and implemented power characterization and
        high-level power estimation  work-flows for the STBus Network
        on Chip.  The STBus is a high-performance, low-latency on chip
        parameterizable network supported by production grade
        specification and synthesis tools

  title: Task Level Parallelism
  description: |
    During my 4 years stint in the industry, I have worked on
    a variety of projects related to exploiting task level parallelism.
    I have had the opportunity to work within an international team
    on the entire stack of hardware and software design tools for
    an embedded processor.


  achievements:

  -   Specified and validated embedded shared-memory multi-processor
      systems.

  -   Designed run-time and operating system components including
      embedded co-hosting technology for the ST230 microprocessor

  -   Studied and created a parallel programming framework for
      industrial multi-processor architectures

  -   Specified secure storage extensions for embedded processors

  -   Developed secure co-hosting solutions for industrial applications

  -   Involved in the study and implementation of novel cryptographic
      power attack techniques based on cache-miss induction
