  title: Power estimation of microprocessors
  problems: ?
  achievements:
    - developed an analytical model that takes into
      account software-level parameters (such as instruction ordering,
      pipeline stall probability and instruction cache miss probability) and
      micro-architectural-level ones (such as pipeline stage power
      per instruction)

    - validated the model on an industrial VLIW processor jointly
      designed by HPLabs and STMicroelectronics.

  title: Power optimization of microprocessors
  problems: ?
  achievements:

    -   defined a register file write inhibition scheme that exploits
        the forwarding paths in VLIW processors.

    -   designed a dynamic power management policy for general
        purpose operating systems.

    -   designed a method for the exploration of the architectural
        parameters of the memory sub-systems, from the energy-delay joint perspective.

    -   developed Multicube Explorer, a tool for experimenting with multi-objective
        exploration.

  title: Parallel systems
  achievements:

  -   Specification, validation and architectural exploration for
      embedded shared-memory multi-processor systems.* This task has been
      carried out at several levels of abstraction by developing software
      tools and models for performance estimation of a cache coherent
      processor system. Moreover he studied and created new run-time and
      operating system components including co-hosted infrastructures. The
      ST200-ISS simulator is one of the research tools developed in
      support of this activity.

  -   Development of stream programming languages and architectures*.
      During this activity, he studied and created a parallel programming
      framework for industrial multi-processor architectures. The activity
      involved the specification and implementation of an advanced
      parallel language and compiler suitable for developing
      streaming-based programs for the embedded and cluster-based
      multi-processor domain. Several prototypes applications such as
      software radio systems have been developed and currently drive the
      industrial evolution of this project. The industrial xSTreamC
      compiler and the nSTream simulator (T2) are the tools developed in
      support of this activity. The tool has been released in the public
      domain in September 2008.

  title: Secure systems
  achievements:
  - In this activity, he has been responsible for the specification and
    implementation of secure storage extensions for embedded processors. He
    developed software tools and methodologies that are currently used by
    industrial research and production groups for supporting next generation
    processors. As a side task, he has also been involved in the study and
    implementation of performance and power models for cryptographic
    applications as well as novel cryptographic power attack techniques
    based on cache-miss induction.

  title: Networks on Chip
  achievements:
  - In this activity he has led the specification, planning and
    implementation of the power characterization and high-level power
    estimation work-flows for the STBus Network on Chip. The STBus is a
    high-performance, low-latency on chip parameterizable network supported
    by production grade specification and synthesis tools.

  title: Design space exploration
  achievements:
  - Platform-based design represents the most widely used approach to design
    System-On-Chip (SoC) applications. In this scenario, Design Space
    Exploration (DSE) allows to find the best trade-offs in terms of the
    selected figures of merit (e.g. energy consumption, task throughput and
    area occupation) by efficiently tuning, either at design time or at
    run-time, the system hardware and software parameters. This research is
    aimed at defining system models and innovative DSE methodologies to

  - Accurate performance and power modeling characterization of
    applications with emphasis on parallel processors architectures and
    network-on-chips.

  - Optimal tuning of the memory hierarchy, processor parallelism (intra
    and inter-task) and processor interconnection network.

  - Optimal software task mapping and scheduling onto the target
    processor units and optimal communication scheduling.

  - Run-time design space exploration for trading-off quality-of-service
    with actual power constraints.

  - Robust optimization with respect to several levels of uncertainties
    such as workload variability, model estimation accuracy and
    manufacturing process variability.

  - Power-conscious micro-architectural optimizations.
