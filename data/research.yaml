  title: Techniques supporting teaching to a massive amount of students
  description: |
    In 2014 I've realized that my computer science class
    was undergoing a major challenge. The number of students was becoming
    huge and resource assignment from my university (in terms of teaching
    assistants funded by the university) was on a decreasing trend.
    In fact, the ratio between qualified teaching
    assistants (those who have a degree in computer engineering) and
    students had fallen below 1/100, making it hard to bring students to
    complete even the simplest hands-on lab.

    I've always had the ambition to not leave anyone behind so I gradually started
    to study the current MOOC technologies to see whether they could be used
    to keep the students on track.

    I am currently creating the first online course that is meant to complement the
    face to face lectures that I give. The course can be edited collaboratively
    by teachers (on Github) through a YAML based format that I've designed;
    it can then be imported into an EDX server to be used by the students who
    can then submit their homework to an automatic grader that I wrote
    using containerization.

  achievements:
    - developed a YAML-based format to author course contents
    - used containerization technology to build automatic graders

    I've been always interested in ways to model complex program
    behavior such as synchronous programming.

  title: Power estimation and optimization of processor-based systems
  description: |
    Since 1999 I've been ... etc...

  achievements:

    -   developed an analytical model that takes into account
        software-level parameters (instruction ordering, pipeline stall
        probability and instruction cache miss probability) and
        micro-architectural-level ones (pipeline stage power per
        instruction)

    -   validated the model on an industrial VLIW processor jointly
        designed by HPLabs and STMicroelectronics

    -   defined a register file write inhibition scheme that exploits
        the forwarding paths in VLIW processors

    -   designed a dynamic power management policy for general purpose operating systems

    -   designed a method for the exploration of the architectural
        parameters of the memory sub-systems, from the energy-delay joint perspective

    -   developed Multicube Explorer, a tool for experimenting with
        multi-objective exploration

    -   developed accurate performance and power modeling characterization of
        applications with emphasis on parallel processors architectures and
        network-on-chips.

    -   developed optimal tuning of the memory hierarchy, processor parallelism (intra
        and inter-task) and processor interconnection network

    -   developed optimal software task mapping and scheduling onto the target
        processor units and optimal communication scheduling

    -   designed run-time design space exploration for trading-off quality-of-service
        with actual power constraints

    -   robust optimization with respect to several levels of uncertainties
        such as workload variability, model estimation accuracy and
        manufacturing process variability

    -   specified and implemented power characterization and
        high-level power estimation  work-flows for the STBus Network
        on Chip.  The STBus is a high-performance, low-latency on chip
        parameterizable network supported by production grade
        specification and synthesis tools
