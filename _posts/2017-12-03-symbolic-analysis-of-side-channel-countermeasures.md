title: Symbolic analysis of side channel countermeasures
---

Cryptography’s current research trends show that there is an increasing
concern about identifying if a side-channel countermeasure is vulnerable
to higher-order attacks.

In a [recent work published this year on IEEE Trans. on
Computers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2635650), me and my
co-authors, Elia Bisi (U. Warwick) and Filippo Melzani (Security
Patterns), just introduced a new mathematical tool to assess the higher
order vulnerability of a hardware cryptographic circuit.

The method empowers the circuit designer to detect if the chosen
countermeasure (Boolean masking or some parts of a *threshold
implementation*) is effective up to the desired order. Our overarching
goal was (and is) to promote the implied statistical reasoning behind
the countermeasure into a symbolical one, eventually extending ordinary
computer aided design of integrated circuits. I'll recap in this post the major findings.

## Background

A *side-channel attack* corresponds to a set of
queries to a *physical observable* whose aim is to identify the value of
a master key/sub-key $K$ of the primitive. 
Cryptographic primitives may expose, through a side-channel, one or many
intermediate *sensitive variables* $S$ that
are deterministic functions of both the master key $K$ and the
public input $P$. To safeguard against a possible vulnerability, a customary
solution is to prevent a *sensitive value* $S$ to become *visible*, by
processing the following value instead:
$$V = S \oplus M_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus M_d \, ,$$ where $\oplus$ is the
bitwise XOR and $M_1, \ldots, M_d$ are random uniformly distributed values
called *masks*. However, this does not rule out the case where some
$S$ can be derived from observations of a (data dependent)
leakage: $$L = \psi(V) + N \, .$$

where $\psi$ is a mapping from the Boolean space, often defined to be the Hamming
weight function.

## Original findings

We now focus on a specific but very common case where
the components of the leakage vector
$L = (L_i)_{i=1}^l$ are of the form
$$\label{eq:leakageModel} L_i = \sum_{j=1}^v c_{i,j}V_j + N_i \qquad
\forall i=1,\dots,l \, ,$$ where $c_{i,j}$’s are real coefficients.
Moreover, we assume that visible variables are
related to masks and sensitive variables by the following matrix
expression in $\mathbb{F}_2$: $${V} =
C \cdot
\begin{bmatrix} {M} \\ {S} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} B & A \end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix} {M} \\ {S}
\end{bmatrix} = B{M} \oplus A{S} \, .$$  
In the paper, we have shown that $S$ is vulnerable to a correlation attack on $L$ 
if there exists a constant
row vector ${\epsilon}=(\epsilon_i)_{i=1}^v\in\mathbb{F}_2^v$ such
that the product
$${\epsilon} {V} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^v \epsilon_i V_i$$ cancels out
any mask contribution (i.e. ${\epsilon} B={0}$). In particular, a vulnerability 
can be found if and only if the reduced
row echelon form $C_R$ has a sensitive pivot column.

## Example
Consider the following visible variables
$(V_1,V_2,V_3,V_4) = {V}$: $$\begin{aligned}
V_1 &= S_1 \oplus M_1 \, , \\
V_2 &= S_2 \oplus M_2 \, , \\
V_3 &= S_1 \oplus S_2 \oplus M_1 \oplus M_2 \, , \\
V_4 &= M_1 \oplus M_2 \, .\end{aligned}$$ 

which corresponds to the following visible matrix $C$:

$$C =
\left[ \begin{array}{cc|cc}
1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right] \, ,
\label{eq:leakageMatrix1}$$ where the vertical line divides the
submatrix $B$, corresponding to the masks $M_1,M_2$, from the submatrix
$A$, corresponding to the sensitive variables $S_1,S_2$. The reduced row
echelon form of $C$ is $$C_R =
\left[ \begin{array}{cc|cc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right] \, .
\label{eq:leakageMatrix2}$$ We can see that the column of $S_1$ is a
pivot column and thus $S_1$ is vulnerabile.
